ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          293
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            76 out of     293   25%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  70 out of     293   23%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         147 out of     293   50%
    Number of unique control sets:              24
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              98 out of  35,200    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
